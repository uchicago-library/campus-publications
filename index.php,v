<h2><!-- <a href="#"> -->Student Publications<!-- </a> --></h2>

<p>Independent student organizations at the University of Chicago have issued many
types of publications: yearbooks, newspapers, humor magazines, literary
journals, and newsletters, among others. Some student titles have had lengthier
runs (the Maroon has been published continuously since 1900), while others have
appeared only once or twice.</p>
